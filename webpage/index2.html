	<h1>Mean Brightness of Cover Photos</h1>
	<p>When graphing the average brightness of the book covers by genre, we see that there are some similarities among genres like crime and science, where they have a peak at 1.0, and for the other genres, horror, romance, and fantasy, they are similar in which they have peaks at about 0.4 to 0.6, although the horror genre is skewed to the right, and romance and fantasy are slightly skewed to the left.</p>

  <h1>Mean Saturation of Cover Photos</h1>
  <p>When calculating the average saturation for each book cover and graphed on the histograms by their genre, we can see that all the genres have a similar curve with their peaks at about 0.3 to 0.5. This shows that there is not much difference in average saturation among the genres.</p>
